## General Information
- The project aims to analyze a dataset of loan applications and repayments.
- Background: Loan repayment prediction and risk assessment are crucial for financial institutions to minimize losses and ensure profitability.
- Business Problem: Identify factors influencing loan defaults and repayment behaviors to improve risk models and lending strategies.
- Dataset: 
  - Loan data sourced from [specific source if known] (extracted from `loan.zip`).
  - A data dictionary was provided to explain the fields in the dataset (`Data_Dictionary.xlsx`).

## Conclusions
- **Conclusion 1:** Certain borrower demographics and financial metrics have a strong correlation with loan repayment rates.
- **Conclusion 2:** Loans with high interest rates tend to show higher default probabilities.
- **Conclusion 3:** Borrowers with a lower credit score are at higher risk of defaulting on loans.
- **Conclusion 4:** Repayment behavior varies significantly across different loan types and amounts.
